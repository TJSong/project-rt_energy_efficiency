% csolve  Solves a custom quadratic program very rapidly.
%
% [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
%
% solves the convex optimization problem
%
%   minimize(quad_form(xx*bb - yy, eye(10)))
%
% with variables
%       bb   5 x 1
%
% and parameters
%       xx  10 x 5
%       yy  10 x 1
%
% Note:
%   - Check status.converged, which will be 1 if optimization succeeded.
%   - You don't have to specify settings if you don't want to.
%   - To hide output, use settings.verbose = 0.
%   - To change iterations, use settings.max_iters = 20.
%   - You may wish to compare with cvxsolve to check the solver is correct.
%
% Specify params.xx, ..., params.yy, then run
%   [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
