.Nm
is a complete browser experience based on
.Xr uzbl-core 1 .
It uses a set of scripts (mostly python and shell) that will fit most
people to ensure that things work out of the box. Thus it provides
everything you would expect from a normal web browser. For instance, URL
changing, history, form filling, link navigation, et cetera.

It ships with a highly adequate default configuration file but if you
want to benefit from the customizable interface you might want to modify
the configuration file.
