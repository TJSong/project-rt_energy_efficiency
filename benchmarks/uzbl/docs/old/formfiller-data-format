FORMFILLER FILE FORMAT

lines starting with '>' are ignored

a file consists of profile definitions
lines between profile definitions are ignored

a line starting with '!profile=' introduces a profile definition
the rest of that line is taken as the profile name
profile names must match the RE /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$/
a line starting with '!' terminates the profile definition
the rest of that line is ignored

a profile definition consists of field definitions
lines between field definitions are ignored

a line starting with '%' introduces a field definition
(details depend on the field type)
the rest of that line shall be in the format ...
  'name(type){value}:checked' for checkbox/radio
  'name(type):value'          for text/password/search
  'name(type):'               for textarea
where name/type/value/checked are the input field's HTML attribute values,
 'name' always being percent encoded, 'checked' being a JS boolean,
 and 'value' being percent encoded if type is checkbox/radio
for all types but textarea, the field definition ends with that single line
for textarea, all lines up to (but excluding) one starting with '%' make up the 'value'
the rest of that line starting with '%' is ignored

for all lines, a leading '\', if present, is removed

a once-edit temporary file consists only of field definitions,
 and lines starting with '!' or '>' are not special
