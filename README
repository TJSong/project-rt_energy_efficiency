This repository contains code related toe experiments for our work on using
execution time prediction to improve energy efficiency in soft real-time (e.g.,
interactive) systems.

Directory structure:
  - atlast-7f660d3: Code from the ATLAS [RTAS 2013] project.
  - data: Some recorded data (Probably out-dated).
  - ffmpeg-1.2: ffmpeg media player. Modifications have been made to collect metrics.
  - mibench: Mibench benchmarks.
  - parse: Code for automatically getting conditional variables and function arguments from gcc AST.
  - scripts: Various scripts for running experiments. Primarily deal with running ffmpeg and libsvm.
  - tar: Original (unmodified) tarballs of code from other projects that were used.
